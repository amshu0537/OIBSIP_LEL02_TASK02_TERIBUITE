  <h2>Early Life</h2>
  <p>
    Her family was of Albanian descent.
    At the age of twelve, she felt strongly the call of God.
    She knew she had to be a missionary to spread the love of Christ.
    At the age of eighteen she left her parental home in Skopje and joined the Sisters of Loreto,
    an Irish community of nuns with missions in India.
    After a few months’ training in Dublin she was sent to India, where on May 24, 1931, 
    she took her initial vows as a nun. From 1931 to 1948 Mother Teresa taught at St. Mary’s High School 
    in Calcutta, but the suffering and poverty she glimpsed outside the convent walls made such a deep 
    impression on her that in 1948 she received permission from her superiors to leave the convent school
     and devote herself to working among the poorest of the poor in the slums of Calcutta. 
     Although she had no funds, she depended on Divine Providence, and started an open-air school 
     for slum children. Soon she was joined by voluntary helpers, 
     and financial support was also forthcoming. This made it possible for her to extend 
     the scope of her work.

  <h2>Work and Achievements</h2>
  <p>
    Mother Teresa's work has been recognised and acclaimed throughout the world and
     she has received a number of awards and distinctions, including the Pope John XXIII 
     Peace Prize (1971) and the Nehru Prize for her promotion of international peace and 
     understanding (1972).In 1962 the Indian government awarded Mother Teresa the Padma Shri, one of its highest civilian honours, for her services to the people of India. Pope Paul VI on his trip to India in 1964 gave her his ceremonial limousine, which she immediately raffled to help finance her leper colony. She was summoned to Rome in 1968 to found a home there, staffed primarily with Indian nuns.

  <h2>Legacy</h2>
  <p>
    “Mother Teresa will be remembered for her compassionate work with the destitute, 
    the outcast and the dying. Those who followed her work say her legacy goes much deeper than 
    establishing one of the world's most extraordinary and extensive charitable networks”.
     (Ribadeneira 1) The power of Mother Teresa’s comforting touch changed the lives of many. 
     When Mother Teresa was twelve years old, she first thought about becoming a nun. 
     Six years later, Mother Teresa decided she wanted to pursue her dream,
      so she got in contact with the Sister of Loreto. According to many sources, 
      Mother Teresa was well on her way to becoming a saint, and her value dedicated to the 
      destitute was extraordinary.

    Mother Teresa is almost on her way to becoming a saint.
     On September 6th, 1997, Mother Teresa died, and Pope John Paul II suggested that she was put 
     on the road to sainthood. As of right now, Mother Teresa is not officially a saint yet. 
     She is only at the beatification stage of sainthood. According to Tom Hundley,
    
    For a person to reach the first stage of sainthood, beatification, 
    there must be one proven posthumous miracle attributed to the candidate.
